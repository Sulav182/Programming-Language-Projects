;Scheme program to filter a list if the element in the list is less that 5.

;sub-function filter1 which takes two argument
(define filter1(lambda(l1 l2)
     		;if list is empty return l2	
		(cond ((null? l1) l2) 
			;if the element of the list is less than five, add the element to list l2
			((< (car l1) 5) (filter1 (cdr l1) (append l2 (list (car l1))))) 
			;otherwise call filter1 on cdr l1	
			(else (filter1 (cdr l1) l2)))	 ))
;main function filter that takes one argument and calls sub-function filter1
(define filter(lambda(l1) 
	
	(filter1 l1 '())))

;Test input: (filter '(1 2 6 8 0 3 4 5))
;Output: (1 2 0 3 4)
