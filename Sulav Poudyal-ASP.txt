% This program checks if the connection of graph is strong,weak or neither.
% The program takes edge as an input with two vertices in it. eg. edge(a,b),edge(a,c),edge(b,c) etc.

% true when there is strong connection and when there is only one edge in the graph 
strong():- sconnect(X,Y,Z).
strong():- 1{edge(A,B):A!=B}1.

% true only when there is a weak connection
weak():-wconnect(X,Y,Z).

% weak connection when three vertices are indirectly connected
wconnect(X,Y,Z) :- edge(X,Z), edge(Z,Y), not edge(X,Y).

% strong connection when three vertices are directly connected
sconnect(X,Y,Z) :- edge(X,Z), edge(Z,Y), edge(X,Y).

% no connection when the vertices are not connected.
neither():- not strong(), not weak().
